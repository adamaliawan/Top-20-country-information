# Country Information Data Analysis Project

This project showcases the use of both Excel and Tableau to analyze country-level data, such as GDP, life expectancy, and smartphone usage. The primary goals are to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and dashboard creation using Excel and Tableau.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- To showcase Excel's capabilities in data formatting, filtering, and visualization.
- To demonstrate the use of Tableau for creating interactive dashboards with insights into country-level statistics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following key variables:
- **Rank**: Country ranking based on different parameters (e.g., GDP per capita).
- **Country**: Name of the country.
- **GDP Per Capita (PPP)**: GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity.
- **Smartphone Users**: The number of smartphone users in each country.
- **Life Expectancy**: Average life expectancy in each country.

### Data Processing in Excel

In Excel, several tasks were performed to clean and prepare the data for visualization:
1. **Data Formatting**:
   - Column C was formatted to display the GDP in British Pounds (Â£).
   - The GDP sheet was converted into a table for easier sorting and filtering.

2. **Filtering**:
   - The data was filtered to display information only for the year 2019.

3. **Charting**:
   - A bar chart was created to visualize the rank, country, and GDP per capita.
   - The chart was customized with titles, labels, and moved to a new sheet named "GDP 2019 Chart."

4. **Sorting**:
   - The data was sorted to display the top 20 countries by GDP rank.
   - A new chart was created to represent the top 20 highest-ranking countries by GDP per capita.

### Tableau Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard was created to provide a more interactive exploration of the data. The dashboard consists of four main sheets:
1. **Smartphone Users**: Visualizes the total number of smartphone users in the top 20 countries.
2. **Life Expectancy**: Displays the life expectancy in the top 20 countries, ordered in descending order.
3. **GDP Per Capita**: Shows the GDP per capita for the top 20 countries.
4. **Geographical Map**: A map displaying the top 20 countries ranked by GDP per capita.

Each sheet uses a color gradient from orange to blue, ensuring accessibility for color-blind users. Orange represents lower values, while blue represents higher values, making the data easy to interpret.

## Key Insights
- **GDP Comparison**: The top 20 countries by GDP per capita provide insight into economic distribution globally.
- **Life Expectancy Trends**: Analysis of life expectancy reveals how different regions perform in terms of healthcare and quality of life.
- **Smartphone Usage**: The total number of smartphone users highlights technological adoption across various countries.
